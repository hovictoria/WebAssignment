## Notes
- All event dates must be set in the future due to form validation rules.
- Past events cannot be edited or deleted — they are view-only.
- Event status (Upcoming / Ongoing / Past) is automatically calculated based on today's date.
- Event images are stored in `public/uploads/` and served statically.
- Students must be logged in to view events, RSVP, comment, or bookmark events.
